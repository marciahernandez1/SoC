# **Project Description**
This project will integrate the Nexxys4 DDR board with a soil moisture sensor. The sensor reads the moisture level when in contact with soil and does analog to digital conversion to determine the level of moisture. 
The display for this can be shown either on the seven segment display with words telling the user the level of moisture and/or additionally implementing the RGB led for this.
